## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Load the dataset from the given file path
```{r}

data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Student/Desktop/OEL DATASETS PFAI/Task 1/WHR2024.csv")

```
2. Display the first 5 rows
```{r}
# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
head(data, 5)

```
3. Get basic summary statistics
```{r}
# Get summary statistics of the dataset
summary(data)

```
4. Identify missing values
```{r}
# Check for missing values (NA) in the dataset
colSums(is.na(data))

```
5. Save the cleaned dataset as cleaned_happiness.csv
```{r}
# Clean the dataset by removing rows with any missing values
cleaned_data <- na.omit(data)

# Define the output file path
output_path <- "C:/Users/Student/Desktop/OEL DATASETS PFAI/Task 1/cleaned_happiness.csv"

# Save the cleaned dataset
write.csv(cleaned_data, output_path, row.names = FALSE)

# Print confirmation message
print(paste("Cleaned dataset saved at:", output_path))

```
head(cleaned_data, 5)
